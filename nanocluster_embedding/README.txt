gen_simulation_box.sh is written in poor style, change it so that generating nanoparticle and combining them together are different processes. Generating fcc sphere is currently put under nanocluster_creation folder

inserparticle.py seems to be an alternative version, check if this works properly as it will probably make gen_simulation_box.sh useless
